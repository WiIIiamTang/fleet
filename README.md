A bandori data viewer for discord. It uses the bandori.party API and bandori database API for songs. English names for cards may not be accurate.


### Info

This discord bot grabs data from the bandori.party and bandori database public apis. It formats the info into readable discord embeds. Features include interactable card embeds, browsing through lists of bandori cards, members, and songs, and a fully functional music bot.


This bot uses the pydori module to get info from the apis, so you can use certain filters.


To get started, 

1. install all the requirements and host the bot somewhere.
2. Create a folder called 'data' and run main.py.
3. To update the database, run rebuild.
